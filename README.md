# Abstract
Garbage management is a major and unsolved
issue across the country. Many countries have unique garbage
management policies. There is no established method to manage
the garbage appropriately. Proper waste recycling can give good
profit to the government. Thatâ€™s why we propose an automation
technique to detect and categorize waste properly. Garbage
classification is an important stage in enabling cost-effective
recycling among the tasks required for recycling. In this research,
we try to recognize single waste objects in photographs and
classify them into recycling categories.
